## 🟢 Easy (Linear Regression) – DS9  
### 📈 Predict Sales from TV Advertising Budget

- Made **Batch Gradient Descent from scratch** to learn how to optimise parameters in linear regression.
- Used "feature normalisation" to make sure that gradient descent converges more quickly and steadily.
- Chose **TV, radio, and newspaper advertising budgets** based on how directly they affect sales.
- Used an 80–20 train–validation split to test how well the model works on new data.
- We chose "Mean Absolute Error" (MAE) for evaluation because it gives a clear picture of the error in real sales units.
- Used the **R² score** to see how well the model explains changes in sales.
- Used **sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression** as a standard to check the custom implementation.
- Noticed that the coefficients and MAE were the same, which confirmed that the gradient descent was set up correctly.
